About the Petition App by Catherine McMahon
github project: https://github.com/CatherineMcMahon/Petition

To Do:
- Timeline Screen w/ white house petitions (try change.org later)
- 'sign' petitions feature
- 'share' petitions to facebook, twitter, email, etc.
- login screen
- sign up screen
- enter as guest -> timeline
- settings screen 
- user profile screen
- polish features and transitions between screens
- (extra) messaging system/ discussion about petitions


Timeline Screen:
- cell, view, search button, setting, label on top, in the view/cell: title (label), desc (lable), signatures gotten out of total (label)

# Objective

This app makes it easy for anyone to learn about and take action on something that matters.

# Audience

This app will appeal to those interested in activism and current users of online petitions such as change.org/etc. Hopefully, with additional features, users can tag petitions, share activism on social media, learn historical context relating to petitions and message with sub-communities of users.

Perhaps, gamification or a more social aspect (ability to follow users, their petitions, interests...) can engage users and outsiders to activism.
