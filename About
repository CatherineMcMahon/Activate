About the Petition App by Catherine McMahon
github project: https://github.com/CatherineMcMahon/Petition

To Do:
- Set up change.org API
- Timeline Screen w/ change.org petitions
- 'sign' petitions
- 'share' petitions to facebook, twitter, email, etc.
- login screen

- user profile screen
- settings screen
- polish features and transitions between screens
- (extra) messaging system/ discussion about petitions

# Objective

This app makes it easy for anyone to learn about and take action on something that matters.

# Audience

This app will appeal to those interested in activism and current users of online petitions such as change.org/etc. Hopefully, with additional features, users can tag petitions, share activism on social media, learn historical context relating to petitions and message with sub-communities of users.

Perhaps, gamification or a more social aspect (ability to follow users, their petitions, interests...) can engage users and outsiders to activism.
